The universe, in its vastness and intricacy, serves as a reminder of God's deliberate and purposeful creation.\n"}}},"page":"78286237-cebf-47f6-9faa-2d466a9618ef","symbol":"07790d8a-5ffc-4a10-a8ec-43475ff82964","index":2},{"id":"3ca6f59a-e4e1-4899-911f-24fd9301de66","content":{"en":{"email":"","heading":"","social_links":[{"icon":"mdi:twitter","link":{"url":"https://twitter.com","label":"Twitter","active":false}},{"icon":"mdi:github","link":{"url":"https://github.com","label":"Github","active":false}}]}},"page":"78286237-cebf-47f6-9faa-2d466a9618ef","symbol":"a125ab0e-1776-4c28-ac41-6272339f2891","index":3},{"id":"747e6145-8866-4d90-b3e6-d11bb63ade89","content":{"en":{"cta":[],"logo":{"size":"6","image":{"alt":"Logoipsum","url":"https://vnshpzknqmdfibnnthhl.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/ddd82512-b988-42e7-865a-02d05bb753f4/1727106399150logo.png"}},"site_nav":[{"link":{"url":"/about","label":"About"},"text":""},{"link":{"url":"/blog","label":"Blog"},"text":""}],"social_links":[{"icon":"mdi:pinterest","link":{"url":"https://pinterest.com","label":"Pinterest","active":false}}]}},"page":"08b969ed-82f1-4b51-bbaf-34c70e69d798","symbol":"6666282d-f70b-4ee5-9425-5308c92f8a74","index":0},{"id":"a5d48114-7186-4ea4-b9a1-128757e1973d","content":{},"page":"08b969ed-82f1-4b51-bbaf-34c70e69d798","symbol":"378c025f-c3c5-4576-88bc-7dc1e3cc677c","index":1},{"id":"24486341-51cc-4fc9-8471-a279fb0637a7","content":{"en":{"image":{"alt":"feather","url":"https://vnshpzknqmdfibnnthhl.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/ddd82512-b988-42e7-865a-02d05bb753f4/1726580296796feather_swinging_air.png"},"content":{"html":"<p>I am a feather in the air, while you still search for the wind</p>","markdown":"I am a feather in the air, while you still search for the wind\n\n"},"heading":"freedom seeker "}},"page":"08b969ed-82f1-4b51-bbaf-34c70e69d798","symbol":"c2cdb1de-8192-4b83-bd13-63ab9f629edd","index":2},{"id":"a4a0131a-8dc5-4c18-b92f-2adf9913ff01","content":{"en":{"email":"","heading":""}},"page":"08b969ed-82f1-4b51-bbaf-34c70e69d798","symbol":"a125ab0e-1776-4c28-ac41-6272339f2891","index":3},{"id":"43094a4b-103d-4837-9d04-b40cba838f49","content":{"en":{"cta":[],"logo":{"size":"6","image":{"alt":"Logoipsum","url":"https://vnshpzknqmdfibnnthhl.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/ddd82512-b988-42e7-865a-02d05bb753f4/1727106399150logo.png"}},"site_nav":[{"link":{"url":"/about","label":"About"},"text":""},{"link":{"url":"/blog","label":"Blog"},"text":""}],"social_links":[{"icon":"mdi:pinterest","link":{"url":"https://pinterest.com","label":"Pinterest","active":false}}]}},"page":"789d21f4-9a29-4c79-9eca-da8077e0f21f","symbol":"6666282d-f70b-4ee5-9425-5308c92f8a74","index":0},{"id":"842de93e-8cb8-488b-900b-15732922b5be","content":{"en":{"image":{"alt":"Perspectives from Ghazali, Rumi, and the Christian Concept of \"Son of God\"","url":"https://vnshpzknqmdfibnnthhl.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/ddd82512-b988-42e7-865a-02d05bb753f4/1726584844575download(4).jpg"},"heading":"The Soul’s Journey","superhead":"10/09/2024"}},"page":"789d21f4-9a29-4c79-9eca-da8077e0f21f","symbol":"f680a455-aee4-4ca0-928a-d9639879b2aa","index":1},{"id":"8210df93-7d4f-46ae-974e-e649832e3a25","content":{"en":{"content":{"html":"<h1 id=\"exploringthesoulsjourneyislamicandchristianperspectives\">Exploring the Soul's Journey: Islamic and Christian Perspectives</h1>\n<p>The concept of the soul and its journey has fascinated philosophers, theologians, and spiritual seekers for centuries.

Christians believe that Jesus is part of the Holy Trinity (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), which represents God’s nature.

The Quran emphasizes Jesus’ role as a prophet and messenger of Allah.

He said, 'Such is Allah, He creates what He wills.'\" [Al-Anbiya' 21:35]</p>\n<p>Thus, the Islamic perspective interprets the title \"Son of God\" metaphorically, acknowledging Jesus' uniqueness while affirming Allah's oneness.</p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>Biblical Texts Interpreting the Title \"Son of God\"</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Several biblical passages suggest that Jesus did not claim divinity in the literal sense.

The Origin of the Soul\nThe Source of the Soul According to Imam Ghazali\n\nGhazali asserts that the soul's source is Allah, as stated in the Quran:\n\n\"Then when I have made him complete and breathed into him of My spirit...\" [Al-Hijr 15:29]\n\nThis verse supports Ghazali's view that the soul is a divine breath from Allah, separating humans from other creatures and making them unique.\nThe Source of the Soul According to Jalal ad-Din Rumi\n\nFor Rumi, the soul originates from Allah and is constantly striving to return to Him.

Christians believe that Jesus is part of the Holy Trinity (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), which represents God’s nature. They affirm Jesus' divinity through biblical texts that describe Him as the Word made flesh, sent to redeem humanity.\n\"Son of God\" as a Metaphor in Islam\n\nIn contrast, Islam rejects the literal interpretation of Jesus as the Son of God. The Quran emphasizes Jesus’ role as a prophet and messenger of Allah. His miraculous birth is described as the result of Allah's decree, not divine lineage:\n\n\"She said, 'How can I have a child when no man has touched me?' He said, 'Such is Allah, He creates what He wills.'\" [Al-Anbiya' 21:35]\n\nThus, the Islamic perspective interprets the title \"Son of God\" metaphorically, acknowledging Jesus' uniqueness while affirming Allah's oneness.\n7. Biblical Texts Interpreting the Title \"Son of God\"\n\nSeveral biblical passages suggest that Jesus did not claim divinity in the literal sense. These texts often highlight His role as a servant of God:\n\n    John 5:30: \"I can do nothing on my own... I seek not my own will but the will of him who sent me.\"\n\n    Mark 12:29: \"The Lord our God, the Lord is one.\"\n\n    Matthew 19:16-17: \"Why do you call me good? No one is good but God alone.\"\n\nThese passages emphasize Jesus' servitude and submission to God's will, aligning with Islamic teachings.\n8. Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, both Islamic and Christian traditions offer profound insights into the concept of the soul and the nature of Jesus. While Ghazali and Rumi emphasize the spiritual aspect and direct relationship with God, the Creator of souls and bodies, pure in their origin, Christianity presents Jesus as a central figure in redemption and salvation. However, texts and interpretations suggest that the title \"Son of God\" should be understood metaphorically, highlighting Jesus' role as a servant of God and his guidance for humanity."}}},"site":"ddd82512-b988-42e7-865a-02d05bb753f4"},{"id":"ddf1d1ba-c2d7-4504-bfa0-7ddffa57a4c5","name":"Hero 4","code":{"js":"","css":"section {\n  background: var(--color-brand);\n  overflow: hidden;\n\n  &.image-left {\n    figure {\n      grid-column: 1;\n      grid-row: 1;\n    }\n    .body {\n      grid-column: 2;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n.section-container {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column-reverse;\n  gap: 2rem;\n\n  @media (min-width: 800px) {\n    display: grid;\n    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;\n    place-items: center;\n    gap: 6rem;\n    padding-block: 3rem;\n  }\n}\n\n.body {\n  color: var(--color-inverted);\n  display: grid;\n  place-items: start;\n  padding-top: 0rem;\n\n  .headline {\n    color: var(--color-heading);\n    font-family: var(--font-heading);\n    font-weight: 700;\n    font-size: clamp(2.75rem, 10vw, 3rem);\n    line-height: 1.1;\n    margin-bottom: 1.5rem;\n  }\n\n  .subheading {\n    font-weight: 400;\n    font-size: 1.125rem;\n    margin-bottom: 2rem;\n  }\n\n  .button {\n    font-weight: 500;\n  }\n}\n\nfigure {\n  position: relative;\n\n  img {\n    border-radius: var(--border-radius);\n    z-index: 1;\n    position: relative;\n  }\n}\n","html":"<section class:image-left={variation === \"image_left\"}>\n  <div class=\"section-container\">\n    <div class=\"body\">\n      <h1 class=\"headline\">{heading}</h1>\n      <div class=\"subheading\">{subheading}</div>\n      {#if link.label}\n        <a href={link.url} class=\"button\">{link.label}</a>\n      {/if}\n    </div>\n    <figure>\n      <img src={image.url} alt={image.alt} />\n    </figure>\n  </div>\n</section>\n"},"fields":[{"id":"nmtqs","key":"heading","type":"text","label":"Heading","fields":[],"options":{},"is_static":false},{"id":"ksftr","key":"subheading","type":"text","label":"Subheading","fields":[],"options":{},"is_static":false},{"id":"cskgc","key":"link","type":"link","label":"Link","fields":[],"options":{},"is_static":false},{"id":"ysrnf","key":"image","type":"image","label":"Image","fields":[],"options":{"size":121,"type":"jpeg","original_type":"jpeg"},"is_static":false},{"id":"rkvdo","key":"variation","type":"select","label":"Variation","fields":[],"options":{"options":[{"label":"Image on right","value":"image_right"},{"label":"Image on left","value":"image_left"}]},"is_static":false}],"content":{"en":{"link":{"url":"/","label":"Get Started"},"image":{"alt":"","src":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1523240795612-9a054b0db644?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=2070&q=80","url":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1523240795612-9a054b0db644?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=2070&q=80","size":null},"heading":"Schedule Meetings in Minutes with Cali","variation":"","subheading":"Get your meetings effortlessly organized with Cali.
